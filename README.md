# CS411 DBS Project: Team Golden State SQL Natives

### Project

Our project aims to make the consumption of NBA statistics interactive, easy and fun by combining multiple data sets from Kaggle with public information (e.g. from [TheSportsDB.com](https://thesportsdb.com/)) to create a holistic search interface that visualizes the insights a user might ask about NBA franchises, games, and players through natural language and filter selections.
